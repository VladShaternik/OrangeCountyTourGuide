    <string name="beach_description_1">Finding a piece of the beach that is so clean and pristineâ€¦
        Taking one back to the 40s is a delight. It is right in the middle of
        California Pacific Highway crowds and yet it is a step back in time. The restaurant had
        great food and an ambiance that matched that long ago quiet while listening to the waves
        and watching the sea birds.</string>

    <string name="beach_description_2">There are only a few towns in the Gold Coast that reach
        the level of Newport Beach. The beaches are the best. The restaurants are unbelievable
        in style and taste. Some of the best shopping in California. Gelson\'s Market is the
        best market in Orange County. You will not see more exotic cars anywhere. You have to go
        through the harbor for a cruise and see the biggest display of private yachts and water
        front homes in California. If you are here during Christmas a restaurant view of the parade
        of lights is a must. This town is the Gem of the Gold Coast.</string>

        Parking is almost non-existent, but available on PCH and across PCH off Nye\'s Pl.
        There is even an underpass below PCH to get back to the south side of PCH.
        Look for thick metal walkway rails leading down to the beach between houses.
        It looks private, but it\'s a state beach, all are welcome! Best tip,
        get there very early and enjoy the day!</string>

        will give you the motivation to complete the task. It\'s not 1000, but it will seem
        like it once you\'ve gone up those stairs a few times. Many have come to challenge
        themselves by going up these steps over 5 or 10 times. Give it a try and enjoy the

    <string name="wildlife_area_address_5">Entrance, Huntington Beach, CA 92647</string>
    <string name="wildlife_area_description_5">Bolsa Chica is a small area just North of
        Huntington Beach Dog Back on Pacific Coast Highway that provides visitors an
        opportunity to observe, photograph and relax in a little oasis on the way to
        Seal Beach in California. There is a small parking lot connecting to Pacific Coast Highway.
        After exiting your vehicle, you notice a walkway to the North that is paved.
        Directly ahead is a wooden sturdy bridge leading to the opposite bank.
        Water in the pool has direct access to the Pacific Ocean. As the tide comes in,
        the water level increases. Ocean birds congregate in the protected area. There
        is no hunting or fishing within this area. There you will find an abundance of
        photographers. The scope and variety of birds will keep you excited about what
        you will see next. There are also sea animals that may enter and leave at will.
        It is a nice place to unplug from the civilization for a while.</string>

    <string name="wildlife_area_description_7">The National Wildlife Refuge in Seal Beach offers
        opportunities to see what is being done to protect our endangered species and wetlands,
        conservation efforts to protect native habitat, and raise awareness about the human impact
        on our environment. A tour of the Refuge is offered on the last Saturday of the month
        (as noted in the Seal Beach Sun). The tour is interesting and eye-opening and well worth the
        time. It is especially good for school groups, clubs, scouts, and community members who
        want to learn about wildlife and environmental issues. When you travel on PCH, a section
        of the highway between Seal Beach and Sunset Beach has been adopted by the Friends
        of the Refugeâ€”another indication of the concern the Refuge volunteers have for our
        local environment. Participate and support the efforts of the
        Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge!</string>

    <string name="wildlife_area_address_9">8548 Canyon View Ave, Orange, CA 92869â€“5883</string>
    <string name="wildlife_area_description_9">Peters Canyon Regional Park is a beautiful hiking
        park. The trails are well developed with use. It is rare to find yourself alone on
        the trails - they are much used and much loved. The hikes offer a variety of levels
        so read the maps in the parking lot. The lake has been dry for a few years, but
        when the lake is full, your hike will feel like you have found Heaven. The
        parking lot is small. You can park in the neighborhoods around Peter\'s Canyon Park,
        but be respectful of homeowners and their property. Pack a snack and hike to the highest
        point in the park. You\'ll be thrilled with the find of a park bench and one
        BEAUTIFUL view of OC. This is a hiking park you don\'t want to miss.</string>
